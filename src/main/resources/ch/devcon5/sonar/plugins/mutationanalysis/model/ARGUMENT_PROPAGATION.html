<div id="ARGUMENT_PROPAGATION">
  <h2>Argument Propagation Mutator (ARGUMENT_PROPAGATION)</h2>

  <p>
  This operator replaces the return value of a method parameter, whose type matches the return type, with the
  value of the parameter. Hence, it is only applicable to non-void methods.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>For example:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public String aMethod() {
  String aValue = "example";
  return bMethod(aValue);
}

private String bMethod(String param) {
  return param + " not mutated";
}
    </pre>

  is mutated to

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public String mutatedMethod() {
  String aValue = "example";
  return aValue;
}
    </pre>
  <p>see <a href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators#ARGUMENT_PROPAGATION">Pitest Mutators</a></p>
