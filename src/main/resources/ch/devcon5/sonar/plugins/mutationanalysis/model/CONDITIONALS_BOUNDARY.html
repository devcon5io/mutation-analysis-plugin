    <h2>Conditionals Boundary Mutator (CONDITIONALS_BOUNDARY)</h2>

    <p>This operator replaces relational operators <code>&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=</code> with their conditional boundary
        counterparts according to the following table</p>

    <table class="table">
        <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>
                Original
            </th>
            <th>
                Mutation
            </th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;</td>
            <td>&lt;=</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;=</td>
            <td>&lt;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&gt;</td>
            <td>&gt;=</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

            <td>&gt;</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>For example</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
if (a &lt;= b) {
  // some code
}
</pre>

    <p>will be mutated to</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
if (a &lt; b) {
  // someCode
}
