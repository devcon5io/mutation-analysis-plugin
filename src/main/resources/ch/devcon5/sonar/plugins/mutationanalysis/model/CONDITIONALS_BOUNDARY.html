  <h2>Conditionals Boundary Mutator (CONDITIONALS_BOUNDARY)</h2>

  <p>
  This operator replaces relational operators <code>&lt;, &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=</code> with their conditional boundary
  counterparts according to the following table
  </p>

  <table class="table">
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Original
      </th>
      <th>
        Mutation

    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;</td>
      <td>&lt;=</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&lt;=</td>
      <td>&lt;</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&gt;</td>
