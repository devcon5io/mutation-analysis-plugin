<div id="VOID_METHOD_CALLS">
    <h2>Void Method Call Mutator (VOID<em>METHOD</em>CALLS)</h2>

    <p>Method without a return value - void methods - do not produce an explicit result that is assigned to a
        variable. This could be a call of a setter or a message to an external system or underlying components for
        which the effects require more effort to verify. This operator removes such method calls. </p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public void aMethod(String s) {
  // some Code
}

public String bMethod() {
  String s = "example";
  aMethod(s);
  return s;
}
</pre>

    <p>will be changed to</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public void aMethod(String s) {
  // someCode
}

public String bMethod() {
  String s = "example";
  return s;
}
</pre>

    <p>Constructor calls are not considered as method calls and are therefore not affected by this operator.
        To mutate constructor calls, refer to the
        <a href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators#CONSTRUCTOR_CALL">Constructor Call Mutator</a> or the
        <a href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators#NON_VOID_METHOD_CALL">Non Void Method Call
            Mutator</a> if you want to mutate method calls that produce a return value.</p>
