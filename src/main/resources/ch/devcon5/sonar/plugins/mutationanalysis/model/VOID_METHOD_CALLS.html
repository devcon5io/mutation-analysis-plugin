<div id="VOID_METHOD_CALLS">
  <h2>Void Method Call Mutator (VOID<em>METHOD</em>CALLS)</h2>

  <p>
  This operator mutates methods without a return value - void methods - that do not produce an explicit result that
  is assigned to a variable. This could be a call of a setter or a message to an external system or underlying
  component for which the effects requires more effort to verify. This operator removes such method calls.
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public void aMethod(String s) {
  // some Code
}

public String bMethod() {
  String s = "example";
  aMethod(s);
  return s;
}
    </pre>

  <p>will be changed to</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public void aMethod(String s) {
  // someCode
}

public String bMethod() {
  String s = "example";
  return s;
}
    </pre>

  <p>
  Constructor calls are not considered as method calls and are therefore not affected by this operator.
  To mutate constructor calls, refer to the
  <a href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators#CONSTRUCTOR_CALL">Constructor Call Mutator</a> or the
  <a href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators#NON_VOID_METHOD_CALL">Non Void Method Call Mutator</a> if you
  want to mutate method calls that produce a return value.
  </p>
  <p>see <a href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators#VOID_METHOD_CALLS">Pitest Mutators</a></p>
