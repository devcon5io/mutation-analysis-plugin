<div id="NULL_RETURN_VALUES">
  <h2>Null Return Values Mutator (NULL_RETURN_VALUES)</h2>

  <p>This operator mutates all non-primitive return values by replacing them with <code>null</code>.</p>
  <br>
  As this mutator produces mutations that are very likely to be unstable - causing a NullPointerException that
  is even found by trivial tests - this operator does not mutate the return type, if a more stable return
  value mutation exists.
  <br>
  It does further not mutate methods that are annotated with <code>@NotNull</code>
</div>
