<div id="INCREMENTS">
    <h2>Increments Mutator (INCREMENTS)</h2>

    <p>
        This operator replaces increments with decrements and vice versa. It mutates increments, decrements, assignment
        increments and decrements of stack variables (local variables).</p>

    <p>For example</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public int aMethod(int i) {
  i--;
  return i;
}
</pre>

    <p>will be mutated to</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public int aMethod(int i) {
  i++;
  return i;
}
</pre>

    <p>Only increments and decrements of local variables are mutated. Member variables and the increments and
        decrements thereof will be covered by the <a href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators#MATH">Math Mutator</a>.
    </p>
