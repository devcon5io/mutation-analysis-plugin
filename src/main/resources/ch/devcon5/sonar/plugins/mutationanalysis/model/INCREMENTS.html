<div id="INCREMENTS">
  <h2>Increments Mutator (INCREMENTS)</h2>

  <p>
  This operator replaces increments with decrements and vice versa. It mutates increments, decrements, assignment
  increments and decrements of stack variables (local variables).
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>For example</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public int aMethod(int i) {
  i--;
  return i;
}
    </pre>

  <p>will be mutated to</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public int aMethod(int i) {
  i++;
  return i;
}
    </pre>

  <p>
  Only increments and decrements of local variables are mutated. Member variables and the increments and
  decrements thereof will be covered by the <a href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators#MATH">Math Mutator</a>.
