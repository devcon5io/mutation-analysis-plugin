<div id="EXPERIMENTAL_NAKED_RECEIVER">
  <h2>Experimental Naked Receiver Mutator (EXPERIMENTAL_NAKED_RECEIVER)</h2>

  <p>
  This operator replaces a call to a method with the receiver of the method (the instance on which the method
  is invoked), if the return type of the method is the same as the receiver.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>For example:</p>

  <pre><code>
  public String originalMethod() {
    String someString = "original";
    return someString.toUpperCase();
  }
    </code></pre>
  is mutated to
  <pre><code>
  public int mutatedMethod() {
    String someString = "original";
    return someString;
  }
    </code></pre>
  as the return type of <code>toUpperCase()</code> is the same as the type of <code>someString</code>
</div>
