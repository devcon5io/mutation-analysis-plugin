<div id="EXPERIMENTAL_NAKED_RECEIVER">
    Mutation operator that replaces a call to method with the receiver of the method (the instance on which the
    method is invoked), if the return type of the method is the same as the receiver.
    <br>
    For example:

    <pre><code>
    public String originalMethod() {
      String someString = "original";
      return someString.toUpperCase();
    }
    </code></pre>
     is mutated to
    <pre><code>
    public int mutatedMethod() {
      String someString = "original";
      return someString;
    }
    </code></pre>
    as the return type of <code>toUpperCase()</code> is the same as the type of <code>someString</code>
</div>
