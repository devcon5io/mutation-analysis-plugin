    <p>Example</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
int a = b + c;
</pre>

    <p>will be mutated to</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
int a = b - c;
</pre>

    <p>The <code>+</code> operator on <code>String</code>s is overloaded and is not mutated by this operator.
    </p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
String a = "a" + "Text";
</pre>

    <p>is a string concatenation and not a mathematical operator. The compiler replaces this concatenation with
        something like</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
String a = new StringBuilder("a").append("Text").toString();
</pre>

    <p>For increments, decrements and assignment increments and decrements of member variables (non-local) the compiler
        will also use binary arithmetic operations. Although a special <code>iinc</code> opcode exists for increments,
        but it is restricted to local variables (stack variables) and is not applicable to member variables. Hence,
        the math mutages will also mutate

        Please note that the compiler will also use binary arithmetic operations for
        increments, decrements and assignment increments and decrements of non-local
        variables (member variables) although a special <code>iinc</code> opcode for increments
        exists. This special opcode is restricted to local variables (also called stack
        variables) and cannot be used for member variables. That means the math operator
        will also mutate</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public class Example {
  private int a;

  public void inc() {
    this.a++;
  }
}
</pre>

    <p>to</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public class Example {
  private int a;

  public void inc() {
    this.a = this.a - 1;
  }
}
</pre>
