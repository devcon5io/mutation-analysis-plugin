  <h2>Math Mutator (MATH)</h2>

  <p>
  This operator mutates binary arithmetic operations for integer or floating point arithmetic by replacing one
  operator with another. Operation according the following ruleset.
  </p>

  <table class="table">
    <thead>

  <p>Example</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
int a = b + c;
    </pre>

  <p>will be mutated to</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
int a = b - c;
    </pre>

  <p>
  The <code>+</code> operator on <code>String</code>s is overloaded and is not mutated by this operator.
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
String a = "a" + "Text";
    </pre>

  <p>
  is a string concatenation and not a mathematical operator. The compiler replaces this concatenation with something like
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
String a = new StringBuilder("a").append("Text").toString();
    </pre>

  <p>
  For increments, decrements, assignment increments, and assignemnt decrements of member variables (non-local) the
  compiler will also use binary arithmetic operations. Although a special <code>iinc</code> opcode exists for
  increments, but it is restricted to local variables (stack variables) and is not applicable to member variables.
  Hence, the math mutators will also mutate.

  Please note that the compiler will also use binary arithmetic operations for increments, decrements and
  assignment increments and decrements of non-local variables (member variables) although a special <code>iinc
  </code> opcode for increments exists. This special opcode is restricted to local variables (also called stack
  variables) and cannot be used for member variables. That means the math operator will also mutate.

public class Example {
  private int a;

  public void inc() {
    this.a++;
  }
}

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public class Example {
  private int a;

  public void inc() {
    this.a = this.a - 1;
  }
