<div id="REMOVE_CONDITIONALS">
    <h2>Remove Conditionals Mutator (REMOVE_CONDITIONALS)</h2>

    <p>This operator will replace all conditional expressions so that that they always evaluate to true, so that the
        path guarded by the condition will always be executed.
    </p>

    <p>Example</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
if (a != b) {
  // some code
}
</pre>

    <p>will be mutated to</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
if (true) {
  // some code
}
</pre>

    <p>This operator is not enabled by default. Nevertheless it is recommended to enable this operator to get full
        coverage on conditional expressions</p>

    <p>see <a href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators#REMOVE_CONDITIONALS">Pitest Mutators</a></p>
