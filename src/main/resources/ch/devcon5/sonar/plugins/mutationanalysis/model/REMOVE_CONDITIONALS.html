<div id="REMOVE_CONDITIONALS">
  <h2>Remove Conditionals Mutator (REMOVE_CONDITIONALS)</h2>

  <p>
  This operator will replace all conditional expressions so that they always evaluate to true, so the path guarded
  by the condition will always be executed.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>For Example</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
if (a != b) {
  // some code
}
    </pre>

  <p>will be mutated to</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
if (true) {
  // some code
}
    </pre>

  <p>
  This operator is not enabled by default. Nevertheless, it is recommended to enable this operator to get full
  coverage on conditional expressions
  </p>
