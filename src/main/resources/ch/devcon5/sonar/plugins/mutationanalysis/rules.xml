	       <h2>Uncovered mutant</h2>
	       <p>A mutant of a class has not been covered by a test at all.</p>
	       <p>An uncovered mutant is also a survived mutant. If you activate this rule, it will produce more issues
	       than the Survived Mutant rule. It's advised to have either this or the Survived Mutant rule activated, but
	       not both, as it will result in duplicate issues.Further it is not recommended to have this rule activated
	       with any of the mutation operator specific rules.</p>
