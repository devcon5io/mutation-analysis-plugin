<div id="CONSTRUCTOR_CALLS">
    <h2>Constructor Call Mutator (CONSTRUCTOR_CALLS)</h2>

    <p>This operator targets at constructors where it replaces the call to the constructor with a <code>null</code> value
        assignment. This should induce <code>NullPointerException</code>.
        Example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public Object aMethod() {
  Example x = new Example();
  return x;
}
</pre>

    <p>will be mutated to</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public Example aMethod() {
  Example x = null;
  return x;
}
</pre>

    <p>This mutation is very likely to cause <strong><code>NullPointerException</code>s</strong> even in test suites
        that do not explicitly test for <code>null</code> value. Nevertheless, even if the test contain no assertion at
        all, if the test runs this code, it is likely to kill this mutation.</p>

    <p>Every other method invocation is not affected by this operator. See <a
            href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators#VOID_METHOD_CALL">Void Method Call Mutator</a>, which mutates
        void methods, and
        <a href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators#NON_VOID_METHOD_CALL">Non Void Method Call Mutator</a>
        mutating non-void methods.</p>
