<div id="CONSTRUCTOR_CALLS">
  <h2>Constructor Call Mutator (CONSTRUCTOR_CALLS)</h2>

  <p>
  This operator targets constructors, where it replaces the call to the constructor with a <code>null</code> value
  assignment. This should induce <code>NullPointerException</code>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>For Example:</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public Object aMethod() {
  Example x = new Example();
  return x;
}
    </pre>

  <p>will be mutated to</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public Example aMethod() {
  Example x = null;
  return x;
}
    </pre>

  <p>
  This mutation is very likely to cause <strong><code>NullPointerException</code>s</strong> even in test suites
  that do not explicitly test for <code>null</code> values. Nevertheless, even if the test contains no assertions
  at all, if the test runs this code, it is likely to kill this mutation.
  </p>

  <p>
  Every other method invocation is not affected by this operator. See <a
  href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators#VOID_METHOD_CALL">Void Method Call Mutator</a>, which mutates
  void methods, and
  <a href="http://pitest.org/quickstart/mutators#NON_VOID_METHOD_CALL">Non Void Method Call Mutator</a>
  mutating non-void methods.
