<div id="EXPERIMENTAL_RETURN_VALUES">
  <h2>Experimental Return Values (EXPERIMENTAL_RETURN_VALUES)</h2>

  <p>
  This operator mutates the return values of method calls depending on the return type.
  </p>

  <p>
  Primitive types are replaces with rules similar to rules of the inline consts operator. Object reference
  replacements are more complex and handled by the <code>ObjectReferenceReplacer</code>.
  </p>
