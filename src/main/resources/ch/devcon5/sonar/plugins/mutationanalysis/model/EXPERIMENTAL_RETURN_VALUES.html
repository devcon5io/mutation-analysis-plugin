<div id="EXPERIMENTAL_RETURN_VALUES">
    <h2>Experimental Return Values (EXPERIMENTAL_RETURN_VALUES)</h2>

    <p>
        The return values of method calls are mutated by this operator depending on the return type.
    </p>

    <p>Primitive types are replaces with rules similar to rules of the inline consts operator. Object reference
        replacesments are more complex and handled by the <code>ObjectReferenceReplacer</code>.
