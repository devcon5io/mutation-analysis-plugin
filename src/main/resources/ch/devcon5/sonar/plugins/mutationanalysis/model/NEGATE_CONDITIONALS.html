  <h2>Negate Conditionals Mutator (NEGATE_CONDITIONALS)</h2>

  <p>This operator mutates conditional expressions negation.</p>

  <p>Example</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
if (a != b) {
  // some code
}
    </pre>

  <p>will be mutated to</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
if (a == b) {
  // some code
}
    </pre>

  <p>or</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
if (a &lt;= b) {
  // some code
}
    </pre>

  <p>will be mutated to</p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
if (a &gt; b) {
  // some code
}
    </pre>

  <p>
  There is an overlap with the conditional boundary operator. The conditionals negation however is more unstable and
  is therefore easier to be killed by a test.
