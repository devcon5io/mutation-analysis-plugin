    <p>Example</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">

  // some code

</pre>

    <p>will be mutated to</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
if (a == b) {
  // some code
}
</pre>

    <p>or</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
if (a &lt;= b) {
    // some code
}
</pre>

    <p>will be mutated to</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
if (a &gt; b) {
  // some code
}
</pre>


    <p>The is an overlap with the conditional boundary operator. The conditionals negation however is more unstable and
        is therefore easier to be killed by a test.
